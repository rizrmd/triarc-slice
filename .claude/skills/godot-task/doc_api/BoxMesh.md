## BoxMesh <- PrimitiveMesh

Generate an axis-aligned box PrimitiveMesh. The box's UV layout is arranged in a 3×2 layout that allows texturing each face individually. To apply the same texture on all faces, change the material's UV property to `Vector3(3, 2, 1)`. This is equivalent to adding `UV *= vec2(3.0, 2.0)` in a vertex shader. **Note:** When using a large textured BoxMesh (e.g. as a floor), you may stumble upon UV jittering issues depending on the camera angle. To solve this, increase `subdivide_depth`, `subdivide_height` and `subdivide_width` until you no longer notice UV jittering.

**Props:**
- size: Vector3 = Vector3(1, 1, 1)
- subdivide_depth: int = 0
- subdivide_height: int = 0
- subdivide_width: int = 0
