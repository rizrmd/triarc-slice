## CheckBox <- Button

CheckBox allows the user to choose one of only two possible options. It's similar to CheckButton in functionality, but it has a different appearance. To follow established UX patterns, it's recommended to use CheckBox when toggling it has **no** immediate effect on something. For example, it could be used when toggling it will only do something once a confirmation button is pressed. See also BaseButton which contains common properties and methods associated with this node. When `BaseButton.button_group` specifies a ButtonGroup, CheckBox changes its appearance to that of a radio button and uses the various `radio_*` theme properties.

**Props:**
- alignment: int (HorizontalAlignment) = 0
- toggle_mode: bool = true
