## Signal

Signal is a built-in Variant type that represents a signal of an Object instance. Like all Variant types, it can be stored in variables and passed to functions. Signals allow all connected Callables (and by extension their respective objects) to listen and react to events, without directly referencing one another. This keeps the code flexible and easier to manage. You can check whether an Object has a given signal name using `Object.has_signal`. In GDScript, signals can be declared with the `signal` keyword. In C#, you may use the `Signal` attribute on a delegate. Connecting signals is one of the most common operations in Godot and the API gives many options to do so, which are described further down. The code block below shows the recommended approach. **[code skip-lint]Object.connect()[/code] or [code skip-lint]Signal.connect()[/code]?** As seen above, the recommended method to connect signals is not `Object.connect`. The code block below shows the four options for connecting signals, using either this legacy method or the recommended `Signal.connect`, and using either an implicit Callable or a manually defined one. While all options have the same outcome (`button`'s `BaseButton.button_down` signal will be connected to `_on_button_down`), **option 3** offers the best validation: it will print a compile-time error if either the `button_down` Signal or the `_on_button_down` Callable are not defined. On the other hand, **option 2** only relies on string names and will only be able to validate either names at runtime: it will generate an error at runtime if `"button_down"` is not a signal, or if `"_on_button_down"` is not a method in the object `self`. The main reason for using options 1, 2, or 4 would be if you actually need to use strings (e.g. to connect signals programmatically based on strings read from a configuration file). Otherwise, option 3 is the recommended (and fastest) method. **Binding and passing parameters:** The syntax to bind parameters is through `Callable.bind`, which returns a copy of the Callable with its parameters bound. When calling `emit` or `Object.emit_signal`, the signal parameters can be also passed. The examples below show the relationship between these signal parameters and bound parameters. **Note:** In a boolean context, a signal will evaluate to `false` if it's null (see `is_null`). Otherwise, a signal will always evaluate to `true`.

**Methods:**
- connect(callable: Callable, flags: int = 0) -> int
- disconnect(callable: Callable)
- emit()
- get_connections() -> Array
- get_name() -> StringName
- get_object() -> Object
- get_object_id() -> int
- has_connections() -> bool
- is_connected(callable: Callable) -> bool
- is_null() -> bool
