## EncodedObjectAsID <- RefCounted

Utility class which holds a reference to the internal identifier of an Object instance, as given by `Object.get_instance_id`. This ID can then be used to retrieve the object instance with `@GlobalScope.instance_from_id`. This class is used internally by the editor inspector and script debugger, but can also be used in plugins to pass and display objects as their IDs.

**Props:**
- object_id: int = 0
