## AnimatableBody3D <- StaticBody3D

An animatable 3D physics body. It can't be moved by external forces or contacts, but can be moved manually by other means such as code, AnimationMixers (with `AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process` set to `AnimationMixer.ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS`), and RemoteTransform3D. When AnimatableBody3D is moved, its linear and angular velocity are estimated and used to affect other physics bodies in its path. This makes it useful for moving platforms, doors, and other moving objects.

**Props:**
- sync_to_physics: bool = true
