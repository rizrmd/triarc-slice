## SeparationRayShape2D <- Shape2D

A 2D ray shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a CollisionShape2D. When a SeparationRayShape2D collides with an object, it tries to separate itself from it by moving its endpoint to the collision point. For example, a SeparationRayShape2D next to a character can allow it to instantly move up when touching stairs.

**Props:**
- length: float = 20.0
- slide_on_slope: bool = false
