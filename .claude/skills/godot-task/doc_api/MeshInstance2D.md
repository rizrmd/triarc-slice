## MeshInstance2D <- Node2D

Node used for displaying a Mesh in 2D. This can be faster to render compared to displaying a Sprite2D node with large transparent areas, especially if the node takes up a lot of space on screen at high viewport resolutions. This is because using a mesh designed to fit the sprite's opaque areas will reduce GPU fill rate utilization (at the cost of increased vertex processing utilization). When a Mesh has to be instantiated more than thousands of times close to each other, consider using a MultiMesh in a MultiMeshInstance2D instead. A MeshInstance2D can be created from an existing Sprite2D via a tool in the editor toolbar. Select the Sprite2D node, then choose **Sprite2D > Convert to MeshInstance2D** at the top of the 2D editor viewport.

**Props:**
- mesh: Mesh
- texture: Texture2D

**Signals:**
- texture_changed
