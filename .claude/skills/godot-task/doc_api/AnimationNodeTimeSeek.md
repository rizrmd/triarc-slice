## AnimationNodeTimeSeek <- AnimationNode

This animation node can be used to cause a seek command to happen to any sub-children of the animation graph. Use to play an Animation from the start or a certain playback position inside the AnimationNodeBlendTree. After setting the time and changing the animation playback, the time seek node automatically goes into sleep mode on the next process frame by setting its `seek_request` value to `-1.0`.

**Props:**
- explicit_elapse: bool = true
