## XRCamera3D <- Camera3D

A camera node which automatically positions itself based on XR tracking data. In contrast to XRController3D, the render thread has access to more up-to-date tracking data, and the location of the XRCamera3D node can lag a few milliseconds behind what is used for rendering. **Note:** If `Viewport.use_xr` is `true`, most of the camera properties are overridden by the active XRInterface. The only properties that can be trusted are the near and far planes.

**Props:**
- physics_interpolation_mode: int (Node.PhysicsInterpolationMode) = 2
