## RID

The RID Variant type is used to access a low-level resource by its unique ID. RIDs are opaque, which means they do not grant access to the resource by themselves. They are used by the low-level server classes, such as DisplayServer, RenderingServer, TextServer, etc. A low-level resource may correspond to a high-level Resource, such as Texture or Mesh. **Note:** RIDs are only useful during the current session. It won't correspond to a similar resource if sent over a network, or loaded from a file at a later time. **Note:** In a boolean context, an RID will evaluate to `false` if it has the invalid ID `0`. Otherwise, an RID will always evaluate to `true`. This is equivalent to calling `is_valid`.

**Methods:**
- get_id() -> int
- is_valid() -> bool
